# Kona Route Skill Rationale

- `plan-harder`: enforce phased, dependency-safe implementation order.
- `shell-lint-ps-wsl`: keep all repo commands shell-compatible and linted.
- `discover-observability`: define route search visibility points and traceability needs.
- `python-observability`: wire deterministic route-level debug fields in artifacts/findings.
- `python-testing-patterns`: add deterministic schema and integration tests for route output.
- `testing`: validate non-regression and full-pipeline compatibility.
